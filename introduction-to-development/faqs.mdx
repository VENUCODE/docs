## General Development Workflow

### How long does it take to build an agent?

The timeline depends on complexity and scope:

**Simple Agent (FAQ/Support)**: 1-2 weeks

- Basic conversation flows
- Knowledge base setup
- Single integration
- Standard branding

**Moderate Agent (Lead Gen/Booking)**: 2-4 weeks

- Multiple conversation paths
- CRM integration
- Custom workflows
- Advanced testing

**Complex Agent (Enterprise/Multi-channel)**: 4-8 weeks

- Sophisticated conversation logic
- Multiple integrations
- Custom features
- Extensive testing and stakeholder review

### Can I skip stages in the development lifecycle?

**Not recommended**. Each stage builds on the previous and serves specific purposes:

- Skipping **Test** leads to poor user experiences and emergency fixes
- Skipping **Deploy** planning causes launch issues and downtime
- Skipping **Analyze** means missing optimization opportunities
- Skipping **Iterate** results in stagnant performance

### How many iterations should I plan for?

**Plan for at least 3-5 iterations** in your first year:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Launch">Basic functionality with core features</Step>
  <Step title="Month 1 Optimization">Fixes based on real user feedback</Step>
  <Step title="Month 3 Enhancement">New features based on usage patterns</Step>
  <Step title="Month 6 Expansion">Additional use cases and integrations</Step>
  <Step title="Year 1 Major Update">
    Significant improvements and new capabilities
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Make Stage Questions

### Should I start with a template or build from scratch?

**Start with a template** for 90% of use cases:

**Templates are better when:**

- You're new to Tars platform
- Your use case matches available templates
- You want faster time to market
- You're working with limited resources

**Build from scratch when:**

- You have very unique requirements
- Available templates don't fit your needs
- You have experienced Tars developers
- You need maximum customization

### How detailed should my conversation flows be?

**Start with high-level flows, then add detail**:

**Initial Design (Make Stage)**:

- Map 3-5 primary user scenarios
- Design happy path conversations
- Plan for basic error handling

**Detailed Design (After Testing)**:

- Add edge case handling
- Create fallback responses
- Implement advanced branching logic
- Optimize based on user feedback

### What integrations should I implement first?

**Prioritize by business impact**:

**Essential First**:

- CRM for lead capture
- Knowledge base for information
- Email notifications for alerts

**Add Later**:

- Advanced analytics tools
- Additional business systems
- Custom API integrations

## Test Stage Questions

### Who should be involved in testing?

**Multi-stakeholder approach**:

- Subject matter experts

**External Users (Week 2)**:

- Representative customers/users
- Beta testing groups
- Friendly customers who provide feedback

### How many test scenarios should I create?

**Start with the essential scenarios**:

**Must-Have Scenarios (5-10)**:

- Primary use case happy paths
- Common edge cases
- Integration failure scenarios
- Error recovery situations

**Nice-to-Have Scenarios (10-20)**:

- Unusual but possible user inputs
- Complex multi-turn conversations
- Performance under load
- Cross-channel consistency

### What testing tools does Tars provide?

**Built-in Testing Features**:

- Real-time preview mode
- Conversation simulation
- Integration testing tools

## Deploy Stage Questions

### Should I do a soft launch or full deployment?

**Always do a soft launch first**:

**Soft Launch Benefits**:

- Validate real-world performance
- Catch issues with limited impact
- Gather initial user feedback
- Fine-tune before full release

**Soft Launch Approach**:

- 10-20% of target audience
- 24-48 hours minimum duration
- Monitor key metrics closely
- Fix critical issues before full launch

### What deployment channels should I start with?

**Start with one channel, expand gradually**:

**Recommended First Channel**:

- **Website widget** for most use cases (easiest to control and monitor)
- **WhatsApp** if your audience primarily uses mobile messaging
- **Direct link** for specific campaigns or limited audiences

**Add Additional Channels**:

- After successful single-channel deployment
- Based on user demand and behavior
- When you have resources to support multi-channel

### How do I prepare for deployment issues?

**Comprehensive launch preparation**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Rollback Plan">
    Know how to quickly revert to previous version
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Monitoring">Configure alerts for performance issues</Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Support Team">
    Brief team on potential issues and solutions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Communication Plan">Prepare user communications for issues</Step>
</Steps>

## Analyze Stage Questions

### What metrics should I track?

**Focus on metrics that matter to your business**:

**User Experience Metrics**:

- Task completion rate (target: 80%+)
- User satisfaction score (target: 4.0+/5.0)
- Average conversation length
- Drop-off points in conversations

**Business Impact Metrics**:

- Conversion rate improvements
- Cost savings vs. human agents
- Lead quality and quantity
- Customer service resolution rates

**Technical Performance Metrics**:

- Response time (target: < 2 seconds)
- Uptime and availability (target: 99.5%+)
- Integration reliability
- Error rates by component

### How often should I review analytics?

**Establish regular review rhythm**:

**Daily (First Week Post-Launch)**:

- Monitor for critical issues
- Check user adoption rates
- Verify system stability

**Weekly (Ongoing)**:

- Review key performance metrics
- Identify trending issues
- Check user feedback

**Monthly (Strategic Review)**:

- Comprehensive performance analysis
- Business impact assessment
- Plan optimization priorities

### When should I be concerned about performance?

**Key warning signs**:

❌ **User Experience Issues**:

- Task completion rate below 70%
- User satisfaction below 3.5/5.0
- High drop-off rates in critical flows

❌ **Technical Problems**:

- Response times consistently above 3 seconds
- Uptime below 99%
- Frequent integration failures

❌ **Business Impact**:

- No measurable improvement in target metrics

## Iterate Stage Questions

### How do I prioritize improvements?

**Use impact vs. effort matrix**:

**High Impact, Low Effort (Do First)**:

- Knowledge base additions

**High Impact, High Effort (Plan Carefully)**:

- New major features
- Complex integrations

**Avoid**: Large, sweeping changes

- Harder to isolate what worked/didn't work
- Higher risk of breaking existing functionality
- Longer time to see results

### How do I measure improvement success?

**Before and after comparison**:

  <Step title="Establish Baseline">Document current performance metrics</Step>
  <Step title="Define Success Criteria">Set specific improvement targets</Step>
  <Step title="Implement Changes">Deploy improvements systematically</Step>
  <Step title="Measure Impact">Compare new metrics to baseline</Step>
