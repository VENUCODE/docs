## Timeline and Duration

### Typical Development Cycle

| Stage       | Duration  | Key Deliverables                          |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Make**    | 1-3 weeks | Functional agent, configured integrations |
| **Test**    | 3-5 days  | Validated flows, performance benchmarks   |
| **Deploy**  | 1-2 days  | Live agent, monitoring setup              |
| **Analyze** | Ongoing   | Performance reports, user insights        |
| **Iterate** | 1-2 weeks | Optimized agent, new features             |

### Factors Affecting Timeline

**Complexity Factors:**

- Number of conversation flows
- Integration requirements
- Custom feature needs
- Team experience level
- Stakeholder availability

**Acceleration Factors:**

- Using proven templates
- Leveraging existing integrations
- Clear requirements definition
- Experienced development team
- Automated testing tools

## Success Patterns

### High-Performing Teams Follow This Pattern:

1. **Short Cycles**: 2-4 week iterations
2. **Early Testing**: Test continuously during Make phase
3. **Data-Driven**: Make decisions based on actual usage
4. **User-Focused**: Prioritize user value over technical features
5. **Collaborative**: Include stakeholders throughout the process

<Note>
  **Remember**: This is a cycle, not a linear process. The best agents are those
  that go through multiple iterations, getting better with each cycle based on
  real user feedback and performance data.
