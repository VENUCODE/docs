## Common First-Project Pitfalls

❌ **Skipping the Test Stage**: "It works for me" ≠ ready for users
❌ **Over-Engineering**: Adding features users don't need
❌ **Poor Knowledge Base**: Agents are only as good as their information
❌ **Ignoring Analytics**: Flying blind without performance data
❌ **Not Iterating**: Building once and considering it "done"
