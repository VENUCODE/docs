Before diving into building your first **AI Agent**, let's understand the fundamental concepts that power the **Tars** platform. This page will give you the foundation you need to create intelligent, conversational experiences.



## What is Tars?

Tars is a visual, no-code platform that empowers anyone to build sophisticated **conversational AI Agents (CX Agents)** without writing a single line of code. Using an intuitive **drag-and-drop interface**, you can design conversation flows just like creating a flowchart.

## What is a gambit in Tars?

A gambit represents one single **back-and-forth conversation** between the **Agent** and **User**. 
- It's the fundamental unit of interaction in **Tars**, where each gambit contains the messages your Agent sends and the input options users have to respond. 
- You build conversations by adding **gambits** to your canvas and connecting them to define the **conversation flow**. 
- A series of connected **gambits** creates the complete user journey through your **AI Agent**. 
- **Gambits** must be connected to each other for the conversation to flow. An unconnected gambit will never be executed.

## What are the different types of gambits?

### User input gambits

User input gambits collect specific information from users through structured inputs like text fields, buttons, date pickers, and ratings. Use them to gather validated data such as emails or preferences for personalized interactions.

| Gambit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Text | Collect free-form text responses with validation options (email, phone, full name, etc.) |
| Button | Predefined options users can tap to select |
| Date time | Enable appointment scheduling with calendar integration |
| Star rating | Gather satisfaction scores or feedback with star ratings or scales |
| No input | Display content without requiring user response |
| Cards | Visual cards users can choose from with images and descriptions (coming soon) |
| File upload | Allow users to share documents, images, or other files (coming soon) |
| Location | Capture user location data (coming soon) |

### AI powered gambits

AI-powered gambits use artificial intelligence for dynamic responses, natural language understanding, and tasks like answering FAQs or extracting data. Ideal for flexible scenarios like customer support, they create adaptive conversations that feel human-like.

|Gambit |Description |
|--------|-------------|
| AI Agent  | Handle complete autonomous conversations with access to tools and knowledge |
| Q & A | Answer questions using your Knowledge Base with semantic search |
| Data collector | Pull specific information from user messages (names, dates, emails, entities) |
| Categorizer | Understands what the user wants to accomplish from their message |


### Tool gambits

Tool gambits enable your AI Agent to perform real-time actions by connecting to external tools and services. When a tool gambit is linked to an AI Agent gambit, it allows the Agent to execute tasks like updating CRM records or scheduling appointments using over 600+ pre-built integrations.

### API gambit

The API gambit is a flexible integration tool executed in the conversation workflow. It allows making HTTP requests to any REST API endpoint with custom data, ideal when pre-built tools don't meet your requirements.

### Livechat handoff

Livechat handoff enables escalation to human agents for complex queries or issues AI can't handle. Set conditional rules based on keywords or sentiment to trigger automatic transfers, preserving conversation history for seamless support.

## What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** in **Tars** is a dynamic, goal-driven, and tool-enabled system that can complete complex tasks and transform workflows, going far beyond traditional chatbots or automation scripts.

What does that mean? It means the AI Agent can:
- Understand and pursue specific goals during conversations
- Use built-in tools to fetch data, send emails, or update systems
- Handle multi-step processes autonomously
- Adapt its approach based on user responses and context

For example, instead of just answering questions, it can book a meeting, check inventory, and follow upâ€”all in one chat. This makes it ideal for customer service, sales, or any scenario needing smart, proactive assistance.


## What is a Knowledge Base?

A **Knowledge Base** in **Tars** is a repository of information that your **AI Agent** can reference to answer user questions accurately. **Tars** converts your content into a **vector database** optimized for **semantic search**, meaning your Agent understands the meaning and context of questions to find relevant information even when phrased differently than your source content. You can build **knowledge bases** from **website scraping**, **document uploads**, **structured data files**, or **manual Q&A entry**.

To use a **Knowledge Base**, you connect it as a **"knowledge tool"** to your **AI Agent gambit** in the **AI tools** section. When users ask questions, the **AI Agent** references this tool to retrieve relevant information and formulate accurate responses. This provides **dynamic retrieval** from thousands of documents, keeps information current without rebuilding your Agent, prevents **AI hallucination** by using actual source content, and ensures consistent answers across all conversations.



## Tools

**Tools** in **Tars** are integrations that connect your **AI Agent** to external systems, databases, and services. They transform your Agent from a conversation handler into an action-taker that can interact with your business systems in real-time. **Tars** offers 600+ **pre-built integrations** including **CRM systems** like HubSpot and Salesforce, **productivity tools** like Google Sheets, **communication services**, **calendars**, **payment processing**, and **custom API connections**.

You add **tools** in the **AI tools** section of your gambit configuration, similar to how you add **knowledge tools**. The **AI Agent** understands when to use which tool based on your **base prompt** instructions. This enables reading data like fetching customer information or checking availability, and writing data like creating CRM records, booking appointments, or sending emails. While **knowledge bases** provide information, **tools** enable action - together they make your Agent both knowledgeable and capable of executing real business workflows.



## Conversation flow

A **conversation flow** is the path users take through your Agent, defined by how you connect your **gambits** together using **pipes**. **Gambits** execute sequentially where the user enters and triggers the first gambit, the gambit displays content, the user provides input if required, data is captured in the gambit's variable called **varid**, and then the next gambit triggers following your pipe connection. Data flows between **gambits** through these variables - you reference user responses using `{{ursp.gambit_name}}` and API responses using `{{pre.gambit_name}}` where gambit_name is the **varid** you assigned.

You can create **linear flows** where each gambit leads to the next, **conditional branching** using **branching mode** on button gambits to create separate paths for each option, or **conditional jumps** that evaluate user responses and route to different gambits based on whether conditions are met. Each **pipe connection** represents a decision point in your conversation, and unconnected **gambits** will never execute even if perfectly configured.



## <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" size="30" /> Common beginner mistakes

### Not connecting **gambits**

**Gambits** left unconnected will never execute regardless of configuration. After adding a gambit, immediately connect it with a **pipe** to the previous step and use **preview mode** to verify all paths are accessible.

### Using too many **gambits**

Overcomplicating flows with unnecessary **gambits** makes your Agent harder to maintain. Start with the minimum number needed - a simple conversation might only need three to five **gambits**. Add complexity only when necessary.

### Vague **AI Agent** instructions

The **AI Agent** gambit needs detailed **base prompt** instructions including the Agent's role and purpose, what information sources to use, tone and personality guidelines, and what it should and should not do. Vague instructions lead to generic or unpredictable responses.

### Skipping **Knowledge Base** setup

Without a **Knowledge Base**, your **AI Agent** either makes up answers or gives generic responses. Before deploying customer-facing Agents, create a comprehensive **Knowledge Base** with your documentation, FAQs, and key information.

### Not testing thoroughly

Test every possible **conversation path** using **preview mode**. Try different user responses and verify that **data flows** correctly between **gambits** before deployment.

### Incorrect **data referencing**

Use proper syntax when referencing **data**: `{{ursp.gambit_name}}` for user responses and `{{pre.gambit_name}}` for API data. Avoid spaces in **gambit varids** - use underscores like `user_email` instead of `user email`.

### Over-relying on **AI** alone

Use **AI Agent gambits** for natural conversation and understanding, but switch to **structured gambits** with validation when you need exact data formats like phone numbers or credit card information. This hybrid approach provides natural conversation with reliable data collection.
