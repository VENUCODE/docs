## What is Tars?

Tars is a **no-code AI Agent builder** that empowers anyone to create intelligent conversational experiences without writing a single line of code. Unlike traditional chatbots, Tars focuses on **reliability, accuracy, and complete control** over conversation flows.

Tars replaces static forms and landing pages with dynamic, interactive conversations that guide users progressively through personalized experiences. The platform combines AI-powered conversation handling with visual flow building, extensive tool integrations (600+ pre-built), and robust analytics to deliver measurable business results.

### Key Features
- **No-Code Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for building AI Agents
- **Hybrid AI Search**: Combines traditional search with AI to eliminate hallucinations
- **Gambit-Based Flows**: Visual conversation logic with complete control
- **Multi-Platform Deployment**: Website widgets, WhatsApp, direct links, and custom domains
- **Enterprise Security**: SOC 2 compliant with GDPR and HIPAA support

## AI Agents vs Traditional Chatbots

Traditional chatbots follow rigid, pre-programmed conversation paths that break down when users deviate from expected inputs. Tars AI Agents, however, are sophisticated conversation handlers that understand context and intent.

**Intelligent Conversation Processing**

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Comprehends user intent beyond keyword matching
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and adapts responses
- **Dynamic Intelligence**: Learns from user behavior and conversation flow
- **Tool Integration**: Automatically determines when to use external systems
- **Personality Expression**: Maintains consistent brand voice and behavior

<Check>
AI Agents handle unexpected inputs gracefully, providing human-like conversational experiences that scale your support capabilities.

<Tab title="Traditional Chatbots">
**Rule-Based Decision Trees**

- **Keyword Dependency**: Relies on exact phrase recognition
- **Linear Flow**: Follows rigid, pre-programmed sequences
- **Limited Flexibility**: Breaks with unexpected user inputs
- **Manual Programming**: Requires extensive coding for each scenario
- **Static Responses**: Provides identical outputs for similar inputs

<Warning>
Traditional chatbots struggle with natural language variations and fail when users don't follow expected paths.

## Understanding Gambits in Tars

**Gambits** are the building blocks of your AI Agent's conversation flow. Each gambit represents a specific step or action in your chatbot's logic, similar to nodes in a flowchart. Gambits allow you to visually design complex conversation paths with precise control over how your agent behaves.

### Why Configure Gambits?

Proper gambit configuration ensures your AI Agent:
- Handles user inputs appropriately
- Executes the right actions at the right time
- Provides accurate responses from your knowledge base
- Maintains conversation context and flow
- Escalates to human support when needed

Without proper configuration, your agent may provide irrelevant responses or fail to collect necessary information.

## Types of Gambits in Tars

Tars offers various gambit types to handle different aspects of conversations:

### Input Gambits
Collect different types of user input:
- **Text Input**: Free-form text with validation options
- **Star Rating**: Rating collection (5-star or 10-star scales)
- **Buttons**: Multiple choice selections with branching options
- **Cards**: Interactive cards with images and descriptions
- **Auto Suggestion**: Text input with dropdown suggestions
- **Calendar & Time**: Date and time selection
- **File Upload**: Document and image collection
- **Geolocation**: Location input via map or address
- **Language Selection**: Multilingual support
- **No Input**: Intermediate steps without user interaction

### Action Gambits
Perform specific operations:
- **AI Agent Gambit**: The core AI response handler that processes user queries using your knowledge base
- **API Integration**: Connect to external tools and services
- **Email/SMS**: Send automated communications
- **Live Chat Handoff**: Transfer to human agents
- **Data Storage**: Save conversation data to external systems

### Control Flow Gambits
Manage conversation logic:
- **Conditional Logic**: Branch based on user responses or data
- **Loop**: Repeat actions or questions
- **End Conversation**: Properly close interactions

## What is an AI Agent Gambit?

The **AI Agent Gambit** is the heart of your conversational AI. This special gambit:

- **Processes User Queries**: Uses your configured knowledge base to provide accurate answers
- **Handles Context**: Maintains conversation history and understands follow-up questions
- **Executes Tools**: Automatically calls integrated APIs when appropriate
- **Manages Personality**: Applies your custom prompts and brand voice
- **Ensures Accuracy**: Combines AI with traditional search to eliminate hallucinations

Every conversation typically flows through one or more AI Agent gambits to deliver intelligent responses.

## Connecting Gambits in Tars

**Connecting gambits** creates the conversation flow logic in your AI Agent. Each gambit has **connectors** (lines) that link to the next step based on conditions or user responses.

### How It Works
1. **Sequential Flow**: Gambits connect in order for linear conversations
2. **Conditional Branching**: Different connectors activate based on user choices or data
3. **Looping**: Gambits can connect back to earlier steps for repetition
4. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple paths can run simultaneously

<Note>
Connections define how your agent moves through the conversation tree, ensuring users get the right experience for their specific needs.
</Note>

## Control Flow in Your CX Agent

Control flow in Tars follows a **visual flowchart** approach where gambits represent decision points and actions:

### Flow Movement
1. **User Input** → Triggers the first gambit
2. **Processing** → Each gambit executes its logic
3. **Decision Making** → Connectors determine the next step based on conditions
4. **Output** → Responses are sent to the user
5. **Continuation** → Flow continues until conversation ends

### Example Flow
```
User Question → AI Agent Gambit (search knowledge) → 
Button Selection → Branch to different paths → 
API Call → Email Confirmation → End Conversation
```

The flow can be **linear** (A → B → C) or **branched** (A → B or C depending on conditions).

## What Does Branching Mean in Gambits?

**Branching** allows your AI Agent to take different conversation paths based on user responses, data, or conditions. Instead of following a single linear flow, branching creates a **decision tree** where the conversation adapts to user needs.

### Types of Branching
- **User Choice Branching**: Different buttons lead to different gambits
- **Conditional Branching**: Based on data values or user attributes
- **Fallback Branching**: When primary actions fail
- **Escalation Branching**: Routing to human support

### Example
```
Greeting Gambit
├── Button: "Product Info" → Product Knowledge Gambit
├── Button: "Support" → Support Ticket Gambit  
└── Button: "Sales" → Sales Contact Gambit
```

Branching ensures personalized, relevant conversations instead of generic responses.

## Common Mistakes Beginners Make

### 1. **Poor Knowledge Base Setup**
- Adding irrelevant or outdated content
- Not organizing information logically
- Failing to test knowledge retrieval

### 2. **Over-Complex Flows**
- Creating unnecessarily long conversation paths
- Adding too many branching options
- Not providing clear exit points

### 3. **Ignoring Edge Cases**
- Not handling unexpected user inputs
- Failing to test with diverse user scenarios
- Missing fallback responses for unclear queries

### 4. **Weak AI Agent Configuration**
- Using generic prompts instead of custom ones
- Not defining clear personality and tone
- Ignoring context and conversation history

### 5. **Testing Gaps**
- Only testing happy path scenarios
- Not validating across different devices/channels
- Failing to monitor real user interactions

### 6. **Integration Issues**
- Connecting APIs without proper error handling
- Not securing sensitive data transmission
- Missing authentication for external services

<Tip>
Start simple, test thoroughly, and iterate based on real user feedback. The key to successful AI Agents is continuous improvement through data and user insights.
