#### Conversation source information
- **IP Address**: User's location (e.g., 185.183.33.218)
- **Device Type**: What device they used (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
- **Visited From**: The URL where the conversation started
- **Referred From**: What page or site led them to your Agent
- **Interaction Time**: Exact timestamp when they started chatting

#### Why this matters
- **Track Traffic Sources**: See which pages or sites send you the most users
- **Device Usage**: Know if users prefer mobile or desktop
- **User Journey**: Understand how people find and use your Agent

</Accordion>



<Accordion title="Filter conversations by date">

View conversations from specific time periods to find what you're looking for.

#### How to filter by date
1. Click the **date range selector** in the top-right corner
2. Select **custom dates** using the calendar picker
3. View conversations from your **selected time period**

#### Useful for
- **Weekly Reviews**: Check last week's user interactions

<Accordion title="Debug with Gambit Execution Logs">

See exactly how your Agent processed each conversation to debug issues and understand what happened behind the scenes.

#### How to view Execution Logs
1. Click the **Gambit Execution Log** tab for any conversation
2. Select which **gambit** to examine (Agent, Knowledge, Tools) from the dropdown
3. View the **Input** data that was sent to the gambit
4. View the **Output** data that the gambit produced

#### What input shows you
- **User's Message**: What the user actually typed
- **Previous Context**: Earlier messages in the conversation
- **System Settings**: How your Agent was configured for this interaction

</Frame>

#### What output shows you
- **Agent's Response**: The exact response your Agent generated
- **Tool Actions**: If your Agent sent emails or used other tools
- **Knowledge Used**: What information your Agent found and used
- **Success/Errors**: Whether everything worked correctly or if there were issues

#### Understanding the three execution stages

Each gambit execution goes through three distinct stages that you can examine:

**1. User Interaction Stage**
- **Purpose**: Displays information to the user and collects user inputs
- **What you see**: The messages shown to users and any input they provided
- **Debug use**: Check if users saw the right information and provided expected inputs

**2. Post Stage**
- **Purpose**: Does the main processing work of the gambit
- **What you see**: Internal processing, data transformations, external API calls, and core functionality execution
- **Debug use**: See exactly how the gambit processed inputs and what operations it performed

**3. Jump Stage**
- **Purpose**: Defines which gambit to move to next in the conversation flow
- **What you see**: The logic that determines the next step in the workflow
- **Debug use**: Understand why the conversation moved to a specific gambit or direction

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/data-view/step-5.1-gambit-execution-logs-explain.png" alt="Three stages of gambit execution: User Interaction, Post Stage, and Jump Stage" />
</Frame>

#### Why this helps you debug
- **Find problems**: See exactly which stage failed and why
- **Check processing**: Verify if the gambit's main functionality worked correctly in the Post Stage
- **Understand flow**: See why the conversation moved to specific gambits in the Jump Stage
- **Fix issues**: Identify whether problems are in user interaction, core processing, or flow logic

  **Data View Complete!** You now know how to view conversation history, track where conversations come from, and debug issues using execution logs.
