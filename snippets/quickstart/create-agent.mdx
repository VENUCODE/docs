        Understanding why each section matters for your agent's success:
        
        <Steps>
          <Step title="Personality & Tone" icon="user-tie">
            **What it does:** Defines your agent's character and communication style.
            
            **Why it matters:** This section establishes how users perceive your brand and company. By setting clear guidelines for being professional yet friendly, using Markdown formatting, and keeping responses concise, you ensure every interaction reflects your company's values. This consistency builds trust and makes users feel they're talking to a knowledgeable, helpful representative rather than a robotic chatbot.
          </Step>
          
          <Step title="Knowledge Retrieval & Response Rules" icon="brain">
            **What it does:** Controls how your agent finds and delivers information.
            
            **Why it matters:** This is the brain of your agent - it determines accuracy and reliability. The rule to always use the `knowledge_retrieve` tool ensures your agent only provides accurate, up-to-date information from your official documentation. This prevents hallucinations and keeps responses grounded in facts. The fallback mechanism (politely acknowledging when no answer is found) maintains user trust by being honest about limitations rather than making up answers.
          </Step>
          
          <Step title="Enhanced Support Flow" icon="life-ring">
            **What it does:** Handles situations when your agent can't provide an answer with a clear "Support Mode".
            
            **Why it matters:** This section is your safety net for customer satisfaction. The new "Support Mode" prevents the agent from trying to answer questions once support is requested, ensuring a clean handoff to human support. The structured data collection (name, email, question) and professional HTML email system means your human support team gets all the context they need to provide personalized help quickly. This seamless handoff prevents frustrated users and maintains service quality.
          </Step>
          
          <Step title="Professional Email Template" icon="envelope">
            **What it does:** Provides a beautifully formatted HTML email template for support escalations.
            
            **Why it matters:** Customers receive professional, branded emails that reflect well on your company. The template includes proper styling, all necessary information, and sets clear expectations for response time (24-48 hours). This professional presentation enhances your brand image and improves customer satisfaction.
          </Step>
          
          <Step title="Key Guidelines" icon="shield-check">
            **What it does:** Sets the guardrails that keep your agent focused and effective.
            
            **Why it matters:** These guidelines ensure consistent behavior across all interactions, maintain your brand voice, and keep the agent from going off-topic. The emphasis on Markdown formatting makes responses more readable and professional, while the scope limitation to Tars helpdocs prevents the agent from discussing unrelated topics that could confuse users or damage your brand reputation.
