**How it works:**
1. **User asks a question** - The AI agent receives the question
2. **Agent searches knowledge** - Retrieves relevant information from your knowledge base
3. **Agent provides answer** - Responds based on the knowledge found
4. **If user needs more help** - Agent collects user details and sends email confirmations
5. **Support team gets notified** - Both user and team receive confirmations
