## Agent Workflow Overview

Your AI agent connects to your knowledge sources and tools to provide intelligent support:

    USER(User)
    AGENT(AI Agent)
    KNOWLEDGE(Knowledge Source)
    TOOLS(Tools)
    
    USER --> AGENT
    AGENT --> KNOWLEDGE
    AGENT --> TOOLS

    style AGENT fill:#f3e5f5
    style KNOWLEDGE fill:#e8f5e8
    style TOOLS fill:#fff3e0
```

**How it works:**
1. **User asks a question** - The AI agent receives the question
2. **Agent searches knowledge** - Retrieves relevant information from your knowledge base
3. **Agent provides answer** - Responds based on the knowledge found
4. **If user needs more help** - Agent uses tools to create support tickets and send emails
5. **Support team gets notified** - Both user and team receive confirmations
