- **Advanced Integrations**: When you need custom scopes or endpoints
- **Self-hosted Services**: For on-premises tools with custom OAuth setup

**Common custom fields:**

- **Client ID**: Unique identifier for your application
- **Client Secret**: Secret key for your application
- **Authorization URL**: Where users go to authorize access
- **Token URL**: Where tokens are exchanged
- **Scope**: Specific permissions requested
- **Redirect URI**: Where users are sent after authorization

  configuration. Contact your system administrator if you need help with custom
  OAuth setup.

<Warning>
  **Security**: Keep your Client Secret secure and never share it publicly.
  Store it safely as it provides access to your OAuth application.
