**Basic Authentication**

Traditional username and password authentication for tools that don't support modern OAuth.

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare credentials">
  - Ensure you have your tool account username and password
  - Verify that your account has the necessary permissions
  - Consider using a dedicated service account if available
</Step>

<Step title="Configure in Tars">
  - Go to Tools section in your Tars dashboard
  - Find the tool you want to connect
  - Click **"Connect"** or **"Add Integration"**
  - Select **"Basic Authentication"** as authentication method
</Step>

<Step title="Enter credentials">
  - Enter your **Username** in the username field
  - Enter your **Password** in the password field
  - Add any additional required fields (if applicable)
  - Click **"Test Connection"** to verify
</Step>

<Step title="Complete setup">
  - Review the connection details
  - Click **"Save"** to complete the integration
  - Your tool is now connected and ready to use
</Step>
</Steps>

**Common tools using Basic Authentication:**
- **Legacy Systems**: Older applications that don't support OAuth
- **Internal Tools**: Company-specific applications
- **Database Connections**: Direct database access
- **FTP/SFTP Services**: File transfer protocols
- **Email Servers**: SMTP/IMAP connections

**Security considerations:**
- **Use Service Accounts**: Create dedicated accounts for integrations when possible
- **Limit Permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions to the integration account
- **Regular Rotation**: Change passwords regularly for enhanced security
- **Monitor Access**: Keep track of which accounts are used for integrations

<Warning>
**Security Risk**: Basic authentication transmits credentials in each request. Only use this method when OAuth is not available, and ensure your connection is encrypted (HTTPS).
</Warning>

<Note>
**Alternative**: If the tool supports OAuth 2.0, prefer that method over basic authentication for better security.
