### Next steps

After creating your Agent from scratch:

1. **Test thoroughly**: Use both preview and launch options to test different conversation scenarios
2. **Refine configuration**: Adjust the Agent gambit settings based on your testing results
3. **Add more gambits**: Expand your workflow with additional gambits for complex interactions
4. **Monitor performance**: Track user interactions and optimize based on real usage patterns

<Tip>
  **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic Agent gambit configuration and gradually
  add complexity. You can always enhance your Agent's capabilities by adding
  more gambits and fine-tuning settings.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Testing is Essential**: Always test your Agent thoroughly before deploying
  to production. Use both preview and launch options to ensure your Agent
  behaves as expected across different scenarios.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Full Control**: Creating from scratch requires more time and effort but
  gives you complete control over your Agent's behavior and capabilities. For
