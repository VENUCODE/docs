  **Available options:** - **Add more files**: Click to upload additional PDF
  documents to the same knowledge base - **Fetch content**: Begin content
  extraction from uploaded PDF files - **File management**: View and manage
  uploaded documents
  <Tip>
    **Multiple Documents**: You can add multiple PDF files to create a
    comprehensive knowledge base from various document sources.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate content fetching" stepNumber={7}>
  Click the `Fetch Content` button to begin extracting text and structured data
  from your PDF documents.

  The system extracts and processes text, tables, and document structures from
  your uploaded PDF files stored in cloud storage, preparing the content for the
  subsequent training phase.
  <Warning>
    **Processing Time**: Content extraction may take several minutes depending
    on document size and complexity. Monitor the progress for detailed status
    updates.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Train the KB with selected documents" stepNumber={8}>
  After content extraction completes,initiate training after removing the
  unwanted documents.

  **Agent creation process:** - **Agent initialization**: Begins creating the AI
  Agent with the knowledge base connection - **Gambit configuration**:
  Automatically connects the knowledge base gambit - **System integration**:
  Sets up the Agent to use PDF content for responses - **Deployment
  preparation**: Prepares the Agent for immediate use
  <Info>
    The Agent is being created with your PDF knowledge base pre-configured for
    immediate interaction.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Agent Ready for Interaction" stepNumber={11}>
  Your AI Agent is now ready, and you can interact with it using the chat
  interface.
