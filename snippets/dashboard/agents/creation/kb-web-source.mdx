<Step title="Configure Knowledge Base settings" stepNumber={3}>
  Enter the `Knowledge Base Name` and `Website Base URL`, then configure
  advanced scraping settings if needed.

        />
      </Frame>
      **Advanced configuration options:** - **Number of URLs to scrape**: Set the
      maximum number of URLs to crawl (default: 200, maximum: 10,000) - **Number
      of levels deep**: Define how deep the scraper should go into the website structure
      (default: 20, maximum: 100) - **Custom user Agent**: Optional custom user Agent
      string for web requests - **Crawl using only base URLs**: Ensures crawling
      goes only one level deep, ignoring the depth setting - **Use browser**: Enable
      browser-rendered content in the background instead of raw HTML for dynamic
      content - **Use legacy scraper**: Choose between Scrapy (legacy) and Crawl4AI
      (non-legacy) scraping engines
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  <Tip>
    **Optimal Settings**: For most websites, the default settings (200 URLs, 20
    levels deep) work well. Use the browser option for JavaScript-heavy sites,
    and choose legacy scraper if you encounter compatibility issues with the
    modern Crawl4AI engine.

  **Scraping process:** - **Content discovery**: System discovers and crawls web
  pages, extracting content from each page - **Data processing**: Cleans and
  organizes extracted content for optimal training preparation
  <Warning>
    The fetching process may take several minutes depending on the size of your
    website and the number of pages to scrape.
  </Warning>

<Step title="Train the Knowledge Base" stepNumber={5}>
  After content is successfully fetched, click `Train` to process and train your
  Knowledge Base.

      </Frame>
      **Page selection options:** - Select the pages you want to train - Deselect
      the pages you don't need - View metadata about the number of words fetched
      for each page

      </Frame>
      Monitor the training progress as the system: - Processes and indexes the scraped
      content - Creates searchable knowledge embeddings - Optimizes the content for
      AI understanding - Shows detailed training logs and progress

      </Frame>
      **Training completed:** - View the content that has been trained in the knowledge
      base - See the pages and content the Agent now has knowledge of - Training
      is complete and ready for Agent creation
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  **Training process:** - **Vector storage**: Content is converted to vector
  embeddings and stored in vector databases for fast retrieval - **Index
  optimization**: Creates efficient search and retrieval system for AI responses

  **What happens automatically:** - **Agent creation**: Agent is created with
  your specified name and Knowledge Base gambit connected - **Ready to use**:
  Agent can immediately answer questions based on your website content
