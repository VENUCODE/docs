**Perfect for:**

- **Testing Conversations**: See how your Agent responds to different questions
- **Validating Integrations**: Ensure all connected tools work properly
- **User Experience Testing**: Experience the Agent from a user's perspective
- **Quick Validation**: Verify Agent behavior before making it public
- **Demo Purposes**: Show your Agent to team members or stakeholders

</Tab>

The Edit function opens a modal where you can update the basic information and visual identity of your Agent.

**What you can edit:**

**Specific steps for Edit:** 3. A modal opens with two editable fields:

</Tab>

<Tab title="Duplicate">
**Create a copy of your Agent workflow for testing or variations**

Duplicating an Agent creates a copy of the Agent's workflow and configuration that you can modify without affecting the original.

**What gets duplicated:**

- Agent workflow and conversation logic
- Agent configuration and settings
- Connected integrations and tools
- Knowledge base connections
- Custom responses and behavior

**What does NOT get duplicated:**

- User conversation history and data
- Analytics and performance metrics
- User interactions and feedback
- Any existing user data from the original Agent

**Common use cases:**

- **Testing Changes**: Try new features without risking your live Agent
- **A/B Testing**: Create variations to test different approaches
- **Department Variations**: Adapt the same Agent for different teams
- **Backup Creation**: Keep a copy before making major changes
- **Template Creation**: Use as a starting point for similar agents

**After duplication:**

- The new Agent starts as a draft with a clean slate
- You can modify it independently
- Original Agent remains unchanged
- Both agents can be launched separately
- New Agent starts with no user data or conversation history

<Note>
**Clean Start**: The duplicated Agent will have the same workflow but no existing user data, giving you a fresh start for testing or variations.
</Note>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Delete">
**Remove agents you no longer need**

Deleting an Agent permanently removes it and all associated data from your account. This action cannot be undone.

**What gets deleted:**

- All data related to that Agent
- The workflow that was created
- The Agent disappears from your dashboard
- All conversation history and analytics
- Integration configurations and settings

**Before deleting, consider:**

- **Backup Important Data**: Export any data you want to keep
- **Review Analytics**: Save any important performance insights

<Warning>
**Permanent Action**: Deletion cannot be undone. Make sure you really want to remove this Agent permanently.
