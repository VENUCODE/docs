**Opens your agent in a new tab to test and preview**

Launching your agent opens it in a new browser tab where you can directly access and test the agent's functionality.

**What happens when you launch:**
- Your agent opens in a new browser tab
- You can interact with the agent directly
- All integrations and tools are active for testing
- You can see exactly how users will experience your agent

**Perfect for:**
- **Testing Conversations**: See how your agent responds to different questions
- **Validating Integrations**: Ensure all connected tools work properly
- **User Experience Testing**: Experience the agent from a user's perspective
- **Quick Validation**: Verify agent behavior before making it public
- **Demo Purposes**: Show your agent to team members or stakeholders

**Specific steps for Launch:**
3. A new tab opens with your agent ready for interaction
4. Test conversations, integrations, and user flows
5. Close the tab when finished testing

<Note>
**Testing Only**: This launch action is for testing and preview purposes. It doesn't make your agent publicly available or create any background processes.
</Note>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Edit">
**Modify agent name, description, and logo**

The Edit function opens a modal where you can update the basic information and visual identity of your agent.

**What you can edit:**
- **Agent Name**: Change the display name for easy identification
- **Description**: Update the summary of what your agent does

**Specific steps for Edit:**
3. A modal opens with two editable fields:
   - **Name field**: Update the agent's display name

</Tab>

<Tab title="Duplicate">
**Create a copy of your agent workflow for testing or variations**

Duplicating an agent creates a copy of the agent's workflow and configuration that you can modify without affecting the original.

**What gets duplicated:**
- Agent workflow and conversation logic
- Agent configuration and settings
- Connected integrations and tools
- Knowledge base connections
- Custom responses and behavior

**What does NOT get duplicated:**
- User conversation history and data
- Analytics and performance metrics
- User interactions and feedback
- Any existing user data from the original agent

**Common use cases:**
- **Testing Changes**: Try new features without risking your live agent
- **A/B Testing**: Create variations to test different approaches
- **Department Variations**: Adapt the same agent for different teams
- **Backup Creation**: Keep a copy before making major changes
- **Template Creation**: Use as a starting point for similar agents

**After duplication:**
- The new agent starts as a draft with a clean slate
- You can modify it independently
- Original agent remains unchanged
- Both agents can be launched separately
- New agent starts with no user data or conversation history

<Note>
**Clean Start**: The duplicated agent will have the same workflow but no existing user data, giving you a fresh start for testing or variations.
</Note>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Delete">
**Remove agents you no longer need**

Deleting an agent permanently removes it and all associated data from your account. This action cannot be undone.

**What gets deleted:**
- All data related to that agent
- The workflow that was created
- The agent disappears from your dashboard
- All conversation history and analytics
- Integration configurations and settings

**Before deleting, consider:**
- **Backup Important Data**: Export any data you want to keep
- **Review Analytics**: Save any important performance insights

<Warning>
**Permanent Action**: Deletion cannot be undone. Make sure you really want to remove this agent permanently.
