**Knowledge bases** are intelligent content repositories that store, organize, and process information to enable your AI Agents to provide accurate, contextual responses. They serve as the foundation for building smart assistants that can answer questions, provide support, and deliver domain-specific expertise based on your existing content.

The **Knowledge** page is divided into two primary sections:

- **My Knowledge**: Manage your existing knowledge bases.
- **Add Knowledge**: Create new knowledge bases from various data sources.

<Tip>
  **Regular Updates**: Keep your knowledge bases current by updating content
  regularly and retraining when significant changes occur.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Content Rights**: Ensure you have proper rights to use and process the
  content you're adding to your knowledge bases.
</Warning>

### Next Steps

- **Create your first Knowledge Base** using one of the available data sources
- **Explore advanced features** like content filtering and custom processing
- **Connect knowledge bases to agents** to build intelligent assistants
- **Monitor performance** and optimize based on usage patterns
