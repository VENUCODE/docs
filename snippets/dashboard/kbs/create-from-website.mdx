        This opens the Knowledge Base configuration modal where you can set up your website scraping parameters.
      </Check>
    </Step>

<Step title="Configure basic settings">
  Set up the fundamental information for your Knowledge Base in the basic
  configuration section.

      alt="Basic configuration showing Knowledge Base name and URL fields"
    />
  </Frame>
  **Required fields:** 
  - **Knowledge Base Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your Knowledge Base 
  - **Website Base URL**: Provide the base URL of the website you want to scrape
  <Info>
    The system will use this URL as the starting point for content discovery and
    crawling.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure advanced scraping settings">
  Customize the scraping behavior and parameters for optimal content extraction.

      src="/images/dashboard/agent/knowledge/website/step-2-advanced.png"
      alt="Advanced settings showing scraping configuration options"
    />
  </Frame>
**Advanced configuration options:**

- **Number of URLs to scrape**: Specify the maximum number of pages to crawl. The default is 200, with a maximum limit of 10,000.
- **Crawl depth**: Set the number of levels deep to crawl within the website hierarchy. The default is 20, with a maximum of 100.
- **Custom user agent**: Provide an optional custom identification string for web requests.
- **Base URL crawling**: Limit crawling to a single level by using only base URLs, ignoring the depth setting.
- **Browser rendering**: Enable this option to render content using a browser for sites with dynamic JavaScript.
- **Scraper engine**: Choose between the legacy Scrapy engine and the modern Crawl4AI engine.
  <Tip>
    **Optimal settings**: For most websites, default settings work well. Use
    browser rendering for JavaScript-heavy sites and adjust depth based on your
    site structure.
  </Tip>

  </Frame>
  **Fetching process:**
  - **Content discovery**: The system identifies and navigates through web pages.
  - **Text extraction**: Content is extracted from each identified page.
  - **Data processing**: Extracted content is cleaned and organized.
  - **Progress monitoring**: Real-time logs display scraping activity and status updates.
  <Warning>
    **Scraping Time**: The fetching process may take several minutes depending
    on website size and complexity. Monitor the progress logs for detailed
    status updates.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Review and Select Pages">
  After fetching completes, review the extracted content and select pages for
  training.
