## CSV data source
Create a knowledge base from CSV files by uploading structured data and training it for AI agent use.

<Info>
**CSV Knowledge Base Options**: You can create knowledge bases from two types of CSV files:
- **Table (CSV)**: For structured tabular data with multiple columns
- **Questions & Answers (CSV)**: For Q&A pairs with two columns (Question, Answer)

Both follow the same training process and workflow described below.

</Frame>

  
  This opens the "Add Knowledge Base" modal where you can configure your CSV knowledge base.
  
  <Note>
  **Alternative Option**: You can also click on `Questions & Answers (CSV)` card for Q&A format CSV files. The training process remains the same for both formats.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Knowledge Base" icon="gear">
  In the modal, set up your knowledge base details:

  </Frame>
  
  **Configuration Page Features:**
  - **Data Resources**: Shows your uploaded CSV file
  - **Training Status**: Displays "Not Trained" status for new file
  - **Add Resource**: Button to add more CSV files
  - **Start Training**: Button to begin training the knowledge base
  
  <Info>
  **Training Required**: Your knowledge base must be trained before it can be used by AI agents.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Start Training" icon="play">
  Click the `Start Training` button to begin processing your CSV file.
  
  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/dashboard/knowledge/csv/step-3-while-training.png" alt="Training progress with percentage and status" />
  </Frame>
  
  **Training Phase:**
  - **Initiate Training**: Click the `Start Training` button to begin AI processing.
  - **Data Reading**: The system reads and imports the CSV file for processing.
  - **Resource Processing**: The CSV file is being analyzed and indexed.
  - **Text Chunking**: The data is divided into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient processing.
  - **Embedding Generation**: These chunks are converted into vector embeddings using AI models.
  - **Vector Storage**: The generated embeddings are stored in vector databases like Qdrant and Weaviate for efficient retrieval.
  - **Index Optimization**: The system optimizes the index to enhance search and retrieval performance.
  - **Progress Bar**: Displays the percentage of training completion.
  - **Status**: Indicates "Training..." with an hourglass icon.
  - **Time Estimate**: "This process may take a few minutes."
  
  <Check>
  **Training in Progress**: Wait for training to complete before using the knowledge base.

  </Frame>
  
  **Training Results:**
  - **Status**: "Trained" with green indicator
  - **Success Message**: "All resources have been successfully trained"
  - **Progress Bar**: Shows 100% completion
  - **Ready for Use**: Knowledge base is fully operational
  
  <Check>
  **Knowledge Base Ready**: Your CSV knowledge base is now trained and ready to be used by AI agents.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Add More Resources (Optional)" icon="plus">
  You can add additional CSV files to your existing knowledge base.
  
  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/dashboard/knowledge/csv/step-4-add-new-data-source.png" alt="Add more data resources to existing knowledge base" />
  </Frame>
  
  **Adding Resources:**
  - Click `+ Add Resource` to add more CSV files
  - Same upload process as initial file upload
  - New files will show "Not Trained" status
  - Multiple resources can be added to the same knowledge base
  
  <Info>
  **Resource Management**: Each resource can be managed individually with its own training status.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Retrain Knowledge Base" icon="rotate">
  After adding new resources, retrain the knowledge base to include the new files.
  
  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/dashboard/knowledge/csv/step-5-re-train-for-new-data-source.png" alt="Retraining process with new resources" />
  </Frame>
  
  **Retraining Process:**
  - **Start Training**: Button appears after adding new resources
  - **Training Progress**: Shows progress for all resources
  - **Status Updates**: Individual resource status updates during training
  - **Completion**: All resources show "Trained" status when complete
  
  <Tip>
  **Refresh Page**: If the "Start Training" button doesn't appear, refresh the page to see the updated interface.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="View in Dashboard" icon="eye">
  Your knowledge base is now available in the main Knowledge Base dashboard.
