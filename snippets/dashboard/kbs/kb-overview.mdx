**Knowledge bases** are intelligent content repositories that store, organize, and process information to enable your AI Agents to provide accurate, contextual responses. They serve as the foundation for building smart assistants that can answer questions, provide support, and deliver domain-specific expertise based on your existing content.

The **Knowledge** page is divided into two primary sections:

- **My Knowledge**: Manage your existing knowledge bases.
- **Add Knowledge**: Create new knowledge bases from various data sources.
