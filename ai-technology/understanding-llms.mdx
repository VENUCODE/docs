## What are Large Language Models?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are the AI foundation that powers Tars agents' ability to understand and generate human-like text. These sophisticated neural networks are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand language patterns, context, and meaning.

## How LLMs Power Tars Agents

### Core Capabilities

**Natural Language Understanding**:
- Parse and interpret user input in multiple languages
- Understand context, intent, and nuanced meaning
- Handle variations in expression and communication style
- Recognize and extract key information from conversations

**Response Generation**:
- Create contextually appropriate responses
- Maintain consistent tone and personality
- Adapt language complexity to the audience
- Generate creative and helpful solutions

**Reasoning and Logic**:
- Make connections between different pieces of information
- Apply logical reasoning to solve problems
- Understand cause and effect relationships
- Draw insights from available data
