## Defining AI Agents

AI agents are intelligent software systems that can understand, reason, and act on behalf of users through natural conversation. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow scripted responses, AI agents use advanced language models and contextual understanding to provide human-like interactions.

## Core Characteristics

### üß† Intelligence & Understanding

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands intent beyond keywords
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and state
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: Makes logical connections and inferences
- **Learning & Adaptation**: Improves performance through interactions

### üéØ Goal-Oriented Behavior

- **Task Completion**: Works toward specific objectives
- **Multi-Step Planning**: Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Decision Making**: Chooses appropriate actions based on context
- **Problem Solving**: Finds solutions to user challenges

### üîó Integration & Action

- **Tool Usage**: Connects with external systems and APIs
- **Data Access**: Retrieves and processes real-time information
- **Workflow Automation**: Executes complex business processes
- **Real-World Impact**: Creates tangible outcomes and results

## Traditional Chatbots vs AI Agents
