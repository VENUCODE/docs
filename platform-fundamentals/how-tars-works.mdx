Tars is a **comprehensive conversational AI platform** that enables you to build intelligent agents through a complete development lifecycle. The platform combines AI-powered conversation handling with visual flow building, extensive integrations, and robust analytics to create dynamic conversational experiences that replace static forms and landing pages.

## Core Platform Components

Tars operates through six main components that work together to deliver intelligent conversational experiences:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Agents" icon="robot" >

  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge Bases" icon="database">
    - Intelligent Information Retrieval
    - Vector-based semantic search using Weaviate and Qdrant
    - Multiple content source support with automatic processing
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Tools Integration" icon="wrench">

  </Card>

  <Card title="Data Collector" icon="filter">
    - User Query Extraction. Extracts relevant information from user queries
  </Card>

  <Card title="Categorizer" icon="split">
    - Query Categorization. Categorizes user queries into different branches.Facilitates targeted response generation.Improves conversation flow management
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="User-input" icon="pen-field">
    - Flexible Input Collection. Supports diverse input types including text, star ratings, buttons, interactive cards, auto-suggestions, calendar/time selection, file uploads, geolocation, language selection, and auto page redirection.

### Agentic workflow

Tars agents handle conversations through sophisticated AI processing where the LMS brain internally manages all processing paths:

    style K fill:#fce4ec
    style L fill:#e3f2fd
    style M fill:#e0f2f1
```

### Question Answering Workflow

The Question Answering Workflow uses the same agentic workflow but focuses only on knowledge retrieval:

```mermaid

    A(User Input) --> B[AI Agent]

    B --> C(Knowledge Required?)

    C -->|Yes| D[RAG Retrieval]
    C -->|No| E[Skip Knowledge]

    D --> F[Retrieve]
    F --> G[Augment]
    G --> K[Response Generation]
    K --> I[Contextual Response]

    E --> J[Data Aggregation]
    J --> K[Response Generation]


    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
    style E fill:#e8f5e8
    style F fill:#e8f5e8
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
    style I fill:#e0f2f1
    style J fill:#fce4ec
    style K fill:#e3f2fd
```

<Steps>
<Step title="User Input">
  User asks a question or requests information through any interface (web, WhatsApp, direct link).
</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve">
  Performs vector database search using semantic similarity to find relevant
  knowledge from the knowledge base.
</Step>

<Step title="Augment">
  Combines retrieved knowledge with conversation context and user history for
  comprehensive understanding.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate">
  Creates accurate, knowledge-based responses with source attribution and contextual relevance.
</Step>
</Steps>

- **Custom Workflows**: Conditional logic for complex business processes
- **API Integrations**: Real-time data exchange with external systems

## Knowledge Base Architecture

### Vector Database Technology

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Knowledge Bases"
    icon="database"
  >
    ***Semantic Search Technology*** enables content ingestion from multiple sources, utilizes vector embeddings for meaning-based search, provides context-aware retrieval and ranking, and offers real-time knowledge access.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Vector Databases"
    icon="server"
  >
    ***Weaviate & Qdrant Integration*** involves mathematical content representations, fast semantic search capabilities, scalable storage and retrieval, and performance optimization.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Knowledge Processing Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Data Import">
  Content ingestion from websites, documents, APIs, and manual entry with automatic cleaning and formatting.
</Step>

<Step title="Indexing & Embedding">
  Content conversion to searchable vector embeddings that capture semantic
  meaning and relationships.
</Step>

<Step title="Vector Database Storage">
  Processed embeddings stored in Weaviate and Qdrant for fast, scalable semantic
  search.
</Step>

<Step title="Semantic Search">
  Real-time retrieval of relevant content based on conversation context and user
  intent.
</Step>

<Step title="Contextual Response">
  Integration of retrieved knowledge into natural agent responses with source attribution.
</Step>
</Steps>
