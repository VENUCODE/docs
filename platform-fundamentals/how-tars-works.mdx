Tars is a **comprehensive conversational AI platform** that enables you to build intelligent agents through a complete development lifecycle. The platform combines AI-powered conversation handling with visual flow building, extensive integrations, and robust analytics to create dynamic conversational experiences that replace static forms and landing pages.

### Agentic workflow

Tars agents handle conversations through sophisticated AI processing where the LMS brain internally manages all processing paths:

    A[User Input] --> B[AI Agent]

    B --> C[Knowledge Retrieval]
    B --> D[Tool Action Execution]

    C --> E[Vector Database Search]
    E --> F[Context & Information]

    D --> G[Tool Selection]

    H --> J[Action Results]

    style D fill:#e8f5e8
    style K fill:#fce4ec
    style L fill:#e3f2fd
    style M fill:#e0f2f1
```

### Question Answering Workflow

The Question Answering Workflow uses the same agentic workflow but focuses only on knowledge retrieval:

```mermaid

    A(User Input) --> B[AI Agent]

    B --> C(Knowledge Required?)

    C -->|Yes| D[RAG Retrieval]
    C -->|No| E[Skip Knowledge]

    D --> F[Retrieve]
    F --> G[Augment]
    G --> K[Response Generation]
    K --> I[Contextual Response]

    E --> J[Data Aggregation]
    J --> K[Response Generation]


    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
    style E fill:#e8f5e8
    style F fill:#e8f5e8
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
    style I fill:#e0f2f1
    style J fill:#fce4ec
    style K fill:#e3f2fd
```

<Steps>
<Step title="User Input">
  User asks a question or requests information through any interface (web, WhatsApp, direct link).
</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve">
  Performs vector database search using semantic similarity to find relevant
  knowledge from the knowledge base.
</Step>

<Step title="Augment">
  Combines retrieved knowledge with conversation context and user history for
  comprehensive understanding.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate">
  Creates accurate, knowledge-based responses with source attribution and contextual relevance.
</Step>
</Steps>
