Got it! Here’s a **high-level overview** of how TARS integrates AI Agents with WhatsApp, without diving into internal files or code:

---

## **TARS AI Agents Integration in WhatsApp – Overview**

TARS enables businesses to interact with users on WhatsApp through **AI-powered chatbots**. The integration is designed to handle messaging, conversation logic, and AI responses seamlessly, regardless of the underlying WhatsApp provider.

---

### **1. User Interaction**

* A user sends a message via WhatsApp to a business number.
* This message can be text, media, or interactive elements (buttons, lists, etc.).
* The system captures this input and initiates processing.

---

### **2. Provider Handling**

* WhatsApp messages are received through a **WhatsApp API provider** such as 360Dialog.
* The provider delivers the message to TARS in a standard format.
* TARS manages the communication with the provider to ensure messages can be sent and received reliably.

---

### **3. AI Chatbot Processing**

* Once the message reaches TARS, it is sent to the **chatbot backend**, which acts as the orchestrator for AI processing.
* The chatbot backend communicates with the **AI service**, which houses the AI Agent responsible for understanding the message and generating an appropriate response.
* The AI Agent analyzes the user’s message, considers the conversation context, and determines the next response. This could be:

  * A textual reply
  * An interactive option (button, menu)
  * Media (image, document, audio)
  * Knowledge-based answers

---

### **4. Response Delivery**

* The AI-generated response is sent back from the AI service to the chatbot backend.
* The backend formats the response appropriately for the WhatsApp provider.
* The message is then delivered to the user through the same provider (e.g., 360Dialog), completing the interaction loop.

---

### **5. Additional Capabilities**

* **Conversation Context**: Maintains state to handle multi-turn conversations.
* **Sequential Delivery**: Ensures messages are sent in order and received reliably.
* **Live Chat Handover**: Allows seamless transfer from AI Agent to a human agent if needed.
* **Credits & Usage Tracking**: Tracks conversation usage and ensures any cost-related limits are respected.
* **Media & Interactive Support**: AI responses can include images, files, locations, and buttons, just like native WhatsApp messages.

### **6. End-to-End Flow (High-Level)**

1. **User sends message** → WhatsApp → 360Dialog
2. **Message reaches TARS backend** → Sent to AI service
3. **AI Agent processes message** → Generates response
4. **Response returns to TARS backend** → Formatted for WhatsApp
5. **Message sent to user** → WhatsApp via 360Dialog

> In essence, TARS acts as the bridge between WhatsApp users and AI Agents, ensuring messages flow smoothly, context is preserved, and responses are delivered accurately.
