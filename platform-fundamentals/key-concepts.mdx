## Core Terminology

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you navigate the Tars platform and documentation effectively.

### ü§ñ AI Agents vs Components

**AI Agents**
- Complete conversational entities with personality, knowledge, and capabilities
- Can handle end-to-end conversations independently
- Combine multiple components to deliver comprehensive experiences
- Deploy as standalone applications across multiple channels

**Components**
- Individual building blocks that make up an agent's functionality
- Include gambits, knowledge bases, integrations, and styling elements
- Reusable across multiple agents and scenarios
- Configurable and customizable for specific use cases

### üéØ Conversation Flow Basics

**Gambits**
The fundamental building blocks of conversations in Tars. Each gambit represents a single interaction point with specific functionality:

- **AI Gambits**: Intelligent processing (intent detection, Q&A, data extraction)
- **Input Gambits**: Collect information from users (text, buttons, uploads)
- **Integration Gambits**: Connect with external tools and systems
- **Logic Gambits**: Control conversation flow and decision-making

**The Gambit ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Action Cycle**
```
User Input ‚Üí Gambit Processing ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Knowledge Retrieval ‚Üí Response Generation ‚Üí Next Action
```

**Flow Logic**
- **Sequential Flow**: Move from one gambit to the next in order
- **Conditional Branching**: Different paths based on user responses or data
- **Jumping**: Skip to specific gambits based on logic conditions
- **Loops**: Repeat sections for iterative processes

### üìä Data Flow Overview

**User Input ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Response Path**

1. **Input Capture**: User provides text, selections, or uploads
2. **Intent Processing**: AI analyzes what the user wants to accomplish
3. **Knowledge Search**: System finds relevant information from knowledge bases
4. **Tool Integration**: External systems provide additional data or perform actions
5. **Response Generation**: AI creates contextually appropriate responses
6. **Action Execution**: Any required actions are performed (bookings, data updates, etc.)

### üß† Understanding Intelligence Levels

**Rule-Based Responses (Traditional)**
- Follow pre-defined if/then logic
- Limited to exact keyword matches
- Require manual programming for each scenario
- Break down with unexpected inputs

**AI-Powered Responses (Tars)**
- Understand context and intent
- Handle variations in language and phrasing
- Learn and improve from interactions
- Gracefully handle unexpected scenarios

### üìö Knowledge Management

**Vector Embeddings**
- Mathematical representations of text meaning
- Allow semantic search (meaning-based, not keyword-based)
- Enable finding related concepts and synonyms
- Support multi-language understanding

**Knowledge Sources**
- **Website Scraping**: Automatic content import from URLs
- **Document Upload**: PDFs, Word docs, text files
- **Manual Entry**: Direct FAQ and response creation
- **Structured Data**: CSV files, database connections
- **API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems

**Knowledge Processing**
- **Ingestion**: Content is processed and converted to searchable format
- **Training**: Vector embeddings are created for semantic search
- **Indexing**: Information is organized for fast retrieval
- **Optimization**: Performance tuning for accuracy and speed

### üîÑ Conversation State Management

**Session Context**
- Current conversation state and user progress
- Temporary data collected during the interaction
- User preferences for the current session
- Active tool connections and authentication

**User Profile**
- Long-term user preferences and history
- Previous conversation summaries
- Behavioral patterns and learning data
- Privacy settings and consent status

**Agent Memory**
- Conversation history for context
- User identification and recognition
- Custom variables and data storage
- Integration state and cached results

### üõ†Ô∏è Integration Ecosystem
