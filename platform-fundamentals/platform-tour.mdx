## Step 4: Creating your first AI agent - Choose your adventure!

### Three different ways to create your AI agent

Now comes the exciting part - creating your first AI agent! Tars gives you three different paths to create your AI agent, each perfect for different situations:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="📚 The knowledge expert">
**Perfect for answering questions**

This creates an AI agent that specializes in answering questions based on your business information.

**Great for:**
- Customer support (answering "How do I return this?" or "What are your hours?")
- FAQ bots (answering common questions automatically)
- Information assistants (helping people find what they need)

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose the knowledge path">
  Pick this option when you want your AI agent to be really good at answering questions based on information you already have.
  
  <Card title="📖 Learn More About Knowledge Agents" icon="database" href="/ai-agents/agent-configuration/creating-your-agent">
    **Want to know more?** We have a detailed guide that shows you exactly how to create a knowledge-based agent, with tips and tricks to make it amazing!
  </Card>
</Step>

<Step title="Add your information">
  **You can give your agent information from many sources:**
  - Your website content
  - Documents (PDF files, Word documents, text files)
  - Questions and answers you write yourself
  - Spreadsheets with information
  - Soon: Connect to tools like Confluence or SharePoint
</Step>

<Step title="Train your agent">
  Once you've added all the information, your agent needs to learn and organize it. The agent will process the information and get better at finding the right answers.
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>

<Tab title="🔧 The action hero">
**Perfect for doing things**

This is like creating a super-efficient assistant who can actually DO things for you - like booking appointments, sending emails, or updating your customer database.

**Great for:**
- Booking systems (scheduling appointments automatically)
- CRM helpers (updating customer information)
- Workflow automation (doing repetitive tasks for you)
- Action-oriented assistants (taking care of business tasks)

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose the action path">
  Pick this option when you want your AI agent to actually perform actions and connect to other tools and apps you use.
  
  <Card title="🛠️ Explore All Available Tools" icon="wrench" href="/tools-integration/tools-fundamentals/what-are-tools">
    **Discover 600+ Tools**: We have a complete guide showing you all the tools you can connect to, with step-by-step instructions for each one!

</Step>

<Step title="Teach your agent what to do">
  Once connected, you'll show your agent what actions it can perform with each tool. It's like teaching someone how to use your computer - they learn to click the right buttons and fill out the right forms.
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Create from scratch">
