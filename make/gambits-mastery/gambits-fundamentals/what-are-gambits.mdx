## Understanding Gambits

Gambits are the core building blocks of Tars conversations. Think of them as individual interaction points that handle specific parts of a conversation - from asking questions to processing responses to taking actions. Every conversation in Tars is built using a combination of different gambit types.

## What Makes Gambits Powerful

### Modular Design

Each gambit has a specific purpose and can be combined with others to create complex conversations:

- **Reusable**: Use the same gambit type in multiple places
- **Configurable**: Customize each gambit for its specific context
- **Connectable**: Link gambits together to create conversation flows
- **Testable**: Validate each gambit individually

### AI-Powered Intelligence

Modern gambits leverage artificial intelligence to understand and respond naturally:

- **Context Awareness**: Understand what happened earlier in the conversation
- **Intent Recognition**: Figure out what users really want to accomplish
- **Natural Language**: Handle variations in how users express themselves
- **Learning Capability**: Improve responses based on interactions

## How Gambits Work Together

### Simple Flow Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Welcome Gambit">
    **Type**: AI Agent **Purpose**: Greet user and understand their needs
    **Output**: User intent and initial context
  </Step>

  <Step title="Information Collection">
    **Type**: Text Input or Multiple Choice **Purpose**: Gather specific details
    needed **Output**: Structured data for processing
  </Step>

  <Step title="System Integration">
    **Type**: API Gambit **Purpose**: Look up information or create records
    **Output**: Results from external system
  </Step>

  <Step title="Response Generation">
    **Type**: AI Agent **Purpose**: Provide helpful response with next steps
    **Output**: Natural language response to user
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Flow Features

**Conditional Branching**:

```
User Response → Analysis → Different Path Based on Content
```

**Data Persistence**:

```
Gambit 1 Collects Data → Store in Memory → Gambit 5 Uses Data
```

**Error Handling**:

```
Integration Fails → Fallback Gambit → Alternative Response
```

## Gambit Configuration

### Every Gambit Has:

**Core Settings**:

- **Name and Description**: For team organization
- **Input Requirements**: What data is needed
- **Processing Logic**: How the gambit works
- **Output Format**: What data is provided to next steps

**Advanced Options**:

- **Conditional Logic**: When this gambit should execute
- **Error Handling**: What to do if something goes wrong
- **Validation Rules**: Ensure data quality
- **Timeout Settings**: How long to wait for responses

### Configuration Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clear Naming">
    Use descriptive names that explain the gambit's purpose Example:
    "collect-contact-info" vs "gambit-3"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Comprehensive Error Handling">
    Plan for what happens when things go wrong Have fallback responses and
    alternative paths
  </Step>

  <Step title="User-Friendly Messages">
    Write clear instructions and helpful prompts Test with real users to ensure
    understanding
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validation and Feedback">
    Confirm user inputs and provide immediate feedback Let users know when
    actions are successful
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Design Principles

### User-Centric Design

**Always think from the user's perspective**:

- What do they want to accomplish?
- What information do they need to provide?
- How can we make the interaction as smooth as possible?
- What happens if they make a mistake?

### Progressive Disclosure

**Don't overwhelm users with complexity**:

- Ask for one piece of information at a time
- Build complexity gradually through the conversation
- Provide context about why information is needed
- Allow users to skip optional steps

### Conversation Flow

**Create natural, logical progressions**:

- Start with broad questions, narrow down to specifics
- Confirm understanding before taking actions
- Provide clear next steps and options
- Allow users to change their minds or go back

## Common Gambit Patterns

### Information Gathering Pattern

```
Greeting → Understanding Needs → Collecting Details → Confirmation → Action
```

### Support Ticket Pattern

```
Problem Description → Category Classification → Detail Collection → Ticket Creation → Follow-up
```

### Lead Qualification Pattern

```
Interest Detection → Needs Assessment → Contact Collection → Qualification Scoring → Handoff
```

### Booking Pattern

```
Service Selection → Availability Check → Time Selection → Contact Info → Confirmation
```
