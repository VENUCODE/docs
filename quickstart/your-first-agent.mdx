## Agent Workflow Overview

Your AI agent connects to your knowledge sources and tools to provide intelligent support:

```mermaid

    USER(üë§ User)
    AGENT(ü§ñ AI Agent)
    KNOWLEDGE(üìö Knowledge Source)
    TOOLS(üîß Tools)
    
    USER --> AGENT
    AGENT --> KNOWLEDGE
    AGENT --> TOOLS
    
    style USER fill:#e1f5fe
    style AGENT fill:#f3e5f5
    style KNOWLEDGE fill:#e8f5e8
    style TOOLS fill:#fff3e0
```

**How it works:**
1. **User asks a question** - The AI agent receives the question
2. **Agent searches knowledge** - Retrieves relevant information from your knowledge base
3. **Agent provides answer** - Responds based on the knowledge found
4. **If user needs more help** - Agent uses tools to create support tickets and send emails
5. **Support team gets notified** - Both user and team receive confirmations

---

## Prerequisites

Before we start building, ensure you have everything ready:

- ‚úÖ **Tars Account** - [Create account](/getting-help/account-setup) if you don't have one
- ‚úÖ **Gmail Account** - Use your support email for professional communication  
- ‚úÖ **HubSpot Account** - [Create free account](https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm) for advanced ticket management (optional)

<Info>
**Setup Time:** Account creation takes 2-3 minutes. Gmail is required for all setups, while HubSpot is optional for advanced ticket management.
</Info>

## Add Knowledge Sources

Your AI agent needs knowledge to answer customer questions accurately. Let's add your company's information.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge Bases" icon="database">
    1. **Navigate** to the [Knowledge Bases](https://app.hellotars.com/knowledge) section in your Tars dashboard
    2. **Click** `Add Knowledge` to create a new knowledge base
    3. **Choose** your data source type (`Website`, `PDF`, `CSV`, or `Q&A`)
    4. **Fill** in the required fields
    5. **Add** your Data Resources
    6. **Fetch** your data
    7. **Train** your knowledge base
    8. **Ready to Use** - Knowledge base appears in `My Knowledge Bases` section

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Follow the Detailed Guide" icon="book">
    For complete step-by-step instructions on creating knowledge bases, follow our comprehensive guide:
    
    <Card title="Knowledge Base Creation Guide" icon="book" href="/platform-fundamentals/platform-tour#knowledge">
      Complete guide covering all data source types, training, and testing your knowledge base.
    </Card>
    
    **Quick Overview:**
    - **Website Scraping**: Best for existing FAQ pages or documentation
    - **PDF Upload**: Best for technical manuals and documents

    **What happens next:**
    1. **Fetch Links** - System discovers and scrapes all documentation pages
    2. **Training** - AI processes and indexes the content for search
    3. **Ready to Use** - Knowledge base appears in `My Knowledge Bases` section

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Personality & Tone" icon="user-tie">
            **What it does:** Defines your agent's character and communication style.
            
            **Why it matters:** This section establishes how users perceive your brand and company. By setting clear guidelines for being professional yet friendly, using Markdown formatting, and keeping responses concise, you ensure every interaction reflects your company's values. This consistency builds trust and makes users feel they're talking to a knowledgeable, helpful representative rather than a robotic chatbot.
          </Step>
          
          <Step title="Knowledge Retrieval & Response Rules" icon="brain">
            **What it does:** Controls how your agent finds and delivers information.
            
            **Why it matters:** This is the brain of your agent - it determines accuracy and reliability. The rule to always use the `knowledge_retrieve` tool ensures your agent only provides accurate, up-to-date information from your official documentation. This prevents hallucinations and keeps responses grounded in facts. The fallback mechanism (politely acknowledging when no answer is found) maintains user trust by being honest about limitations rather than making up answers.
          </Step>
          
          <Step title="Escalation & Support Process" icon="life-ring">
            **What it does:** Handles situations when your agent can't provide an answer.
            
            **Why it matters:** This section is your safety net for customer satisfaction. By ending every response with a support offer, you ensure users never feel abandoned. The structured data collection (name, email, question) and automated email system means your human support team gets all the context they need to provide personalized help quickly. This seamless handoff prevents frustrated users and maintains service quality.
          </Step>
          
          <Step title="Key Guidelines" icon="shield-check">
            **What it does:** Sets the guardrails that keep your agent focused and effective.
            
            **Why it matters:** These guidelines ensure consistent behavior across all interactions, maintain your brand voice, and keep the agent from going off-topic. The emphasis on Markdown formatting makes responses more readable and professional, while the scope limitation to Tars helpdocs prevents the agent from discussing unrelated topics that could confuse users or damage your brand reputation.
